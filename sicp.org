* Introduction
Computer science is neither science nor about computers. It has more in common with magic.
The only reason why large programs are possible is because there are techniques fot controlling the complexity of large systems.

** Find approximation to square root: imperative knowledge "how to"
General procedure: to find square root of x
- We make a guess G.
- We improve the guess by averaging G and x/G
- We keep improving our guess until it is "good enough"
- Adding an additional bullet-o
